## 8X8-Led-Grid-Project
#### Welcome to the world of Arduino and Android controlled LED grids! In this project, we will be using an Arduino microcontroller board, a Bluetooth module (HC-05), and an Android device to create a system for controlling a grid of LEDs. The Arduino will be programmed to receive commands from the Android device via Bluetooth, and use those commands to control the behavior of the LEDs. With this setup, you will be able to create custom patterns and animations for the LED grid, all from the convenience of your Android device. So let's get started!
